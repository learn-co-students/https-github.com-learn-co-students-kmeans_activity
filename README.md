# Activity

Let's practice k-means clustering with an image of a piece of art. 

Let's look at a colorful Miro painting with matplotlib.

In a group we will use the KMeans algorithm to reduce the number of colors in the photo.   

Start by reducing the number of colors to 2.  To do so we will have to pass an appropriate argument  when instantianting a KMeans object.  The number of clusters we initiate will determine the number of colors that the image is reduced to.

In order to visualize the groupings, we will replace the original pixel values with the cluster centers associated with the assigned label.

# On your own...
try out different numbers of clusters and see their affect on the painting.
